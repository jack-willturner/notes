# Notes

This repository contains a bunch of short technical notes.

Some of them are meant as educational resources, others are notes to myself. A useful strategy I picked up when I didn't understand a topic during my PhD was to attempt to write a short Jupyter Notebook explaining it with an example. This works particularly well in machine learning where it's easy to generate dummy data and most things are available to you in Python. Most of the time I would find that once I started writing out my questions, it turned out I was missing something fundamental and it all clicked. Those notes got discarded. When it turns out I really *don't* understand a topic, I tend to write a short-to-medium-length technical note and lump it here.
