A random thought that I would like to dump into the world in case anyone has any more thoughts on the topic.

The PDF is a terrible way of doing machine learning research/
1. Reading a pdf is hard (people always want you to send abstract links instead of pdf links because they're easier to read), 
2. Code is completely decoupled from the paper (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/c429429bf1f2af051f2021dc92a8ebea-Paper.pdf) found that code availability had no correlation to reproducibility of results
3. You can't annotate things easily (https://willcrichton.net/nota/, http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html) 
4. Everyone uses their own mathematical notation and we can't do anything about it (https://openreview.net/forum?id=CH0ohlBlrmD)
5. It encourages high throughput without producing meaningful / useable / long-lasting resources
6. Peer review with pdfs is terrible. you have an 8 page paper that usually leaves out all the tricks required for your method to work, and you have to flit between that, the supplementary material, and the included code that you're never going to run yourself

I haven't read it but this textbook is very cool: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/hop/fold.html. It's a jupyter book, each chapter includes embedded videos, code snippets in the text that you can actually run and play with, and exercises

I was thinking that this format of book would make for a good format for a conference proceedings. each chapter is a paper on its own, with a video explanation at the top, and text + code snippets + compilable equations + misc.
